Create a table `T` that has 3 lines, then create a filter that only keeps 2 lines, and display all the filtered table's content.

# ANSWER

A correct answer must have `show table` indented with 2 whitespaces after the `where` statement, as done below:

```envision
table T = with // hard-coding a table
  [| as X |] // column header
  [| "a" |]
  [| "b" |]
  [| "c" |]

where T.X != "a" // filter T, exclude 1 line
  // 2-space ident, because we are within the 'where' block
  // displaying the 2 values
  show table "Filtered" with T.X // only 'b' and 'c'
  // Must be a show table command, not show label.
```
